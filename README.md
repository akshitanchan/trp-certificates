## About The Project

This auto-generator is a code-editor based program that was designed to generate TRP certificates at a large scale and sort them based on geolocation and the receiver's university. The code pumps out the certificates in PDF format. If these are uploaded to a Google Drive folder, you may also email the certificates to the student! This was made possible due to the extensive flexibility of Google's Drive API v3. Using the same and a proprietary SMTP relay, we have created a system that looks for the certificate and emails it to the receiver via SMTP. We have replaced the standard plain-text email format with a heavily-optimized HTML mail format.

Here's why this project was made:
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over.
* Your time should be focused on building something amazing :smile:

Use the `main.py` to get started.

## Built With

Here is a list of the frameworks, libraries and modules we have used to bootstrap this project.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [SMTPLib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)
* [ReportLab](https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/)
* [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api)

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the generator locally. To get a local copy up and running, simply follow the steps below. Make sure all prerequistes are present.

### Prerequisites
The following list of prerequisites assumes that you have Python installed and added to PATH. If not, follow [this guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) to download Python and [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-python-to-windows-path/) to add Python to PATH. Also, make sure you use an appropriate code-editor. I'm partial to VS Code but to each person their own.

* ReportLab

  ```sh
  python -m pip install reportlab
  ```

* Google Drive API

  ```sh
  python -m pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib tabulate requests tqdm
  ```

* Certificate Recipients CSV
  Prepare a list of recipients. Make sure that it follows [this template](). Straying away from the template's formatting would create breaks and errors in the code. Be sure to remove the table header before beginning the import process.

## How to Use

Click [here](https://github.com/sakshiorg/trp-certificate-generator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the entire code as a zipped folder. Unzip the folder where appropriate. Place the prepared CSV file with list of certificate recipients into the assets folder (where the template.csv sits). Rename every occurence of `template.csv` in `main.py` to your CSV file's name. Begin running the `main.py` file. Select the options from the menu as necessary. If you select generation of certificates, a new folder with certificates will be generated. A pre-requisite for mailing certificates is that the generated certificates must be uploaded to a Google Drive, set to view with link, and a user with editor access to those files must authenticate the connection. You can then wait as the files are automatically sent via a Google Drive link (to reduce overhead in mail weight).

## Roadmap

- [x] Add mailing capabilities
- [x] Add specific generation options
- [ ] Add option to generate and mail certificates w/o upload
- [ ] Multi-language Support
    - [ ] Hindi
    - [ ] Other regional languages

See the [open issues](https://github.com/sakshiorg/trp-certificate-generator/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
